    "[Blight violations](http://www.detroitmi.gov/How-Do-I/Report/Blight-Complaint-FAQs) are issued by the city to individuals who allow their properties to remain in a deteriorated condition. Every year, the city of Detroit issues millions of dollars in fines to residents and every year, many of these fines remain unpaid. Enforcing unpaid blight fines is a costly and tedious process, so the city wants to know: how can we increase blight ticket compliance?\n",

    "All data for this assignment has been taken from the [Detroit Open Data Portal](https://data.detroitmi.gov/).\n",
    "\n",
    "Here two datasets have been provided namelt train data and test data. Train data contains the details of each ticket holder from the year 2004-2011 and the test data contains the details of eaach ticket holder from 2012-2016.\n",
    "Each row in these two files corresponds to a single blight ticket, and includes information about when, why, and to whom each ticket was issued. The target variable is compliance, which is True if the ticket was paid early, on time, or within one month of the hearing data, False if the ticket was paid after the hearing date or not at all, and Null if the violator was found not responsible. Compliance, as well as a handful of other variables that will not be available at test-time, are only included in train.csv.\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal is to predict the probability that the ticket will be paid for each ticket holder for the test data."
